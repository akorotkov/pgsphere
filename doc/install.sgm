            <para>
                You will need <application>PostgreSQL
                9.1</application> or above. We assume that you have
                <application>PostgreSQL</application> already compiled and
                installed. Please note: Depending on your system configuration mostly you have to be logged in as the system
                superuser.
            </para>
            <para>
                There are two ways to compile <application>pgSphere</application>.
                The first is to copy the sources into the contribution directory of
                <application>PostgreSQL</application>'s source tree 
                (<filename>POSTGRESQL_SRC/src/contrib</filename>).
                Then, change into <filename>POSTGRESQL_SRC/src/contrib</filename>. 
                If the sources are not yet installed and the directory
                <filename>pg_sphere</filename> does not exist, take the
                gzipped <application>pgSphere</application> sources ( e. g.,
                <filename>pg_sphere_xxx.tgz</filename> ) and run:
            </para>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[shell> tar -xzf path/to/pg_sphere_xxx.tgz]]>
            </programlisting>
            <para>
                Now, change into the <filename>pg_sphere</filename>
                directory and run :
            </para>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[shell> make]]>
            </programlisting>
            <para>
                and to install <application>pgSphere</application> :
            </para>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[shell> make install]]>
            </programlisting>
            <para>
              The second way does not require the <application>PostgreSQL</application> sources but
              the configuration tool <application>pg_config</application>.
            </para>
            <para>
              First unpack the <application>pgSphere</application> sources:
            </para>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[shell> tar -xzf path_to_pg_sphere_xxx.tgz]]>
            </programlisting>
            <para>
              Now, change into the <filename>pg_sphere</filename>
              directory and run:
            </para>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[shell> make USE_PGXS=1 PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config]]>
            </programlisting>
            <para>
              To install <application>pgSphere</application> you have to run :
            </para>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[shell> make USE_PGXS=1 PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config install]]>
            </programlisting>
            <para>
                To check the installation change into the <filename>pg_sphere</filename> source
                directory again and run:
            </para>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[shell> make installcheck]]>
            </programlisting>
            <para>
                The check status will be displayed. Please note, the check gives different results with 
		different <application>PostgreSQL</application>-versions. Currently, the check should
		run without errors with <application>PostgreSQL</application>-version 8.4. Otherwise check
		the file <filename>regression.diff</filename>.

                Please have a look at the

           <para>
               Upgrading PostgreSQL from pre-9.5 versions to 9.5 one through
               <application>pg_upgrade</application> will allow to continue to
               use the <application>pgSphere</application> extension originally
               installed; however, during the first installation of any
               extension all features related to the most recent version (that
               requires core functionalities just lately introduced) are
               generally skipped, and the sole upgrade of PostgreSQL is not
               able to activate them, even if supported by the extension
               itself.

               This is indeed the case of BRIN support in

               are interested to activate BRIN support (adjust
